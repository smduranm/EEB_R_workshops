**Lesson on structural equation modeling (SEM) in R- Dec 7 2017**

In this script, I cover some basics of SEM in R, specifically SEM with observed variables. The script and slides focus on developing models, and understanding model construction. 

This script was developed using some online tutorials and R-code available from Dr. Jarret Byrnes and Bill Shipley. To get help in other types of SEM, and use of other packages (e.g., lavaan) check the references and links below:

+ [Piecewise SEM package](https://jonlefcheck.net/2014/07/06/piecewise-structural-equation-modeling-in-ecological-research/) Useful to learn model specification and run SEMs with no-continuous data.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
