## EEB R Workshops series from Enquist lab

### Workshop details

The EEB_R_workshops are an initiative from the Enquist lab to provide a space where researchers from EEB and other environmental science departments can learn the basis of data analysis and statistical methods, and how to apply them in their ecological research. 

The workshops will be conducted every other **Thursday at 12:30 PM in BSW 219**. Anyone is welcome to teach a lesson, and instructors _are required to generate a R-markdown report at the end of each lesson_ to make the material available online.

Check out our schedule for future workshops on the [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NEVwklU-p2PtpfvUgVEKCb84Lhw-l7pqHVbj4rsy2uI/edit#gid=0), and feel free to add a topic of your interest. For those interested in teaching, please add topic, name, date, and your github ID to add you to the repository as collaborator.
